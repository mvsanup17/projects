        <p>
            Babu had two releases in 2014, the first one being Sukumar's 1: Nenokkadine, an action thriller focusing on a celebrity suffering from hallucinations related to the murder of his parents and the discovery of a special variety of rice. Kriti Sanon played the female lead in this film, marking her acting debut.[91] Made on a budget of around ₹70 crore, 1: Nenokkadine was released amid huge expectations, but received mixed reviews from the critics, turning out to be a box office bomb by 
            incurring a loss of around ₹26–27 crore.[92] However, Babu's performance received praise, with critics calling it one of his best performances
